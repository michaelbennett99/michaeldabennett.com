Customisable chess clock GUI (using iced-rs) and CLI (using termion) application implemented in Rust, backed by a zero-dependency library providing a chess clock API. Built as a quick rust exercise to practice the language and a slightly lengthier exercise to learn one method for building a GUI application.
