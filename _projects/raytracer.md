A C++ ray tracing command line program that implements the ray tracing
algorithms from the books "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" and "Ray Tracing: The
Next Week" by Peter Shirley. Also adds extra features: new shapes including
triangles, and adaptive ray sampler, multithreading, support for diagnostic
images, and a robust command line interface.
