C++ program that implements ray tracing algorithms from the books "Ray Tracing
in One Weekend" and "Ray Tracing: The Next Week" by Peter Shirley, with extra
features:

- **New shapes:** including triangles and ellipses.
- **Additional abstractions:** new classes for ray sampling and image
  construction, allowing for:
  - Adaptive ray sampler.
  - Multithreading.
  - Support for diagnostic images.
- **Robust command line interface:** for rendering different scenes and
  changing rendering parameters.
