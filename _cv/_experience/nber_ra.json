    "Developed two command line applications for genetic data analysis on large human genetic datasets using Python, enabling complex analyses to run in under one hour. Used just-in-time compilation via numba to achieve better performance on non-vectorisable operations.",
    "Designed and implemented internal pipelines using Python, bash, and third-party CLI tools such as PLINK for processing of genetic datasets with sizes between 100GB and 1TB on remote high-performance machines.",
    "Devised methodology to standardize measures of educational attainment across several national-level datasets. Authored the corresponding section in the resulting paper, published in Nature Genetics (2022) with 204 citations as of August 2024.",
    "Developed visualisation software using Python and matplotlib to produce custom publication-ready graphs (including Manhattan plots) and tables, saving development time for other team-members and allowing rapid automated edits prior to submission and resubmission."
